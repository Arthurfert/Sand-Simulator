# Sand-Simulator

A school project to learn object-oriented coding.

## Precise description

This repository aims to simulate the physics of sand, with obstacles, in real time. Each sand particule is a object that act like a *game of life* one at refresh.

**It is coded in C++**, and uses the SFML library.

## Goals

The goal with this project is to :

- Make a real-time sand filler that the user can move with his mouse. *check*
- Make a real-time obstacle maker, following the user's mouse (changing from one another with a stroke). *check*
- Make a 'air' one, that acts like the sand but in reverse, erasing it. *check*
- Add inertia and other things to complexify the simulation and make it more realistic. *arriving*
